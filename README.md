4) Configure the project in the server.
5) To run the project : right click on project -> run on server -> next -> finish
6) Hit this on the browser: http://localhost:8080/SpringMVC/admissionForm.html
 
 "localhost" : the localhost's IP or simply 'localhost'
 
 "8080" : the http port number of the process which is listening to the incoming request.
 
 In this project Spring Dispatcher servlet 3 is used as the default front controller. There are two more dispatcher 
 servlets as well (spring dispatcher servlet and spring dispatcher servlet 2). There are many things in this Spring MVC 
 project. The explanation about how Spring MVC handles things are present within the comment section.
